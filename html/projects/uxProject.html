            <p>
                This project was created with a focus on addressing a real-world problem, prioritizing user experience and interaction at every stage. I chose to design a prototype for a task-tracking app, with the goal of making it significantly simpler and more user-friendly than existing alternatives.                
                <br><br>
                This project was organized into several stages, each completed within 2-3 weeks. The first two stages centered on understanding our target user, while the third and fourth stages focused on developing the product with that user in mind, ensuring a seamless experience with high usability and meaningful interactions.

                This page contains an overview of the project. The whole project is available to view following the link below, and was created using Adobe Express.

                I began by crafting a clear problem statement and researching the demographics most likely to use this application, then developed a survey process. The survey aimed to understand how real-world users interact with similar apps, exploring their preferences, dislikes, and ideas for improvement. Five participants were interviewed, and from these insights, I created empathy maps for each individual, gaining a deeper understanding of their needs and perspectives.
                <br><br>
                These empathy maps were created using Google Drawings.

                I developed a user persona to represent the typical user of my application, along with a comprehensive business model to support its implementation and growth.

                I developed a mind map for my application, centered on the key priorities identified for users in the empathy maps from stage one.

                The mind map was created using the Apple Freeform app.

                I began by creating several low-fidelity prototype sketches, concentrating on the features most important to users. From there, I developed a high-fidelity prototype in Figma, refining and building upon the initial concepts from the low-fidelity prototypes.
                <br><br>
                The low fidelity prototypes were created using the Apple Freeform app, while the high fidelity prototypes were created using Figma, and are available to view following the link below.

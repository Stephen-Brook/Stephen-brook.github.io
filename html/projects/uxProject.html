                <span class="comment">// This project will be complete December 2024</span><br>
                This project was designed around solving a real world problem, putting user experience, and user interaction first. For this proect, I decided to prototype a task tracking app, and aimed to make it much simpler, and easier to use than competitors. 
                <br><br>
                This project was broken down into several stages, each completed in 2-3 weeks. The first two stages focused on the user of our product, the third and fourth stages focused on building the product for that user, being sure to maintain good usability and interactions.
                <br><br>
                <span class="comment">// Stages Five and Six are coming in December 2024</span>
                <br><br>
                The whole project is available to view here, and was created using Adobe Express.

            <p>
                I created a problem statement, researched demographics most likely to use this applicaation, and outlined a survery process. The survey was designed to learn how real world users interact with similar apps, what they like about them, what they dislike about them, and what they think could be done better. A total of five subjects were interviewed. From this stage, I generated empathy maps for each subject.
                <br><br>
                These empathy maps were created using Google Drawings.

                I created a persona to represent the general user of my application. I also created a buisness model for this application.

                The buisness model and persona were created using Google Drawings.

                I created a mind map for my application, focusing on the things that are important to users gathered in the empathy maps during stage 1.

                The mind map was created using the Apple Freeform app.

                I started by creating several low fidelity prototype sketches, focusing on the features most imporant to the users. Then I created a high fidelity prototype using Figma, refining on the ideas from the low fidelity prototype.           
                <br><br>
                The low fidelity prototypes were created using the Apple Freeform app, and the high fidelity prototypes were created using Figma.

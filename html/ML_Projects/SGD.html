            <p>
                I completed this project to introduce myself to the world of machine learning. This project walks through my process of implementing stochastic gradient descent to accurately predict housing prices based off of square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.
                <br><br>
                All of my code, and the dataset I used are available here:

                <br><br>
                This is the small dataset I used for my initial implementations of the algorithm::

                This is the large dataset I used for my final implementation of the algorithm::

                I began by familiarizing myself with the calculus and linear algebra surrounding Stochastic Gradient Descent, and the notation of Machine Learning. This process taught me how machines "learn", and how to implement that learning.
                <br><br>
                Attatched are a selection of my notes on these topics:

            <p>
                This stage started with implementing the update function, with a single dimensional input. In other words, one x to one y.
                <br><br>
                I decided that the best implementation would use a small data set, that I could easily understand and quickly iterate over. In this case, I chose to use a dataset in the real estate market. For the initial implementation, this model is designed to take in an input variable of square footage, and output an estimated price.
                <br><br>
                After implementing this algorithm, the program would produce an output in the form of y=mx+b, which I then plotted against the dataset to see how accurate the function is.
                <br><br>
                The image below shows all of the initial data in green, with a line of best fit plotted by desmos also in green. The red line is the formula that this initial program output.

            <p>
                As mentioned before, the price of a house depends on much more than just the square footage. In other words, I need to make this process work when the input x is multi-dimensional.
                <br><br>
                Attatched are my notes for this process:

    <!-- Multi-Dimensional Inputs -->

        <h2><span class="blue">Multi-Dimensional Inputs</span>  {</h2>
            <p>
                Next, I created a stochastic gradient descent algorithm designed to take in, and utilize a vector of inputs.
                <br><br>
                Because x is now a multi-dimensional vector, I can no longer represent the data as a simple line. I chose to represent the data as I did for the initial implementation, with x being the square footage, and y being the predicted price.
                <br><br>
                The image below shows the same data from the initial implementation of the algorithm, with the green scatter plot and line of best fit. The red points are the results of feeding the initial data through the updated algorithm, and the red line is a line of best fit for that data.

        <p>
            After testing my algorithm on the smaller dataset, and feeling reasonably confident in its results, I decided to use a different, much larger dataset with additional input variables.
            <br><br>
            Initially, the algorithm did not funciton as expected, but after normalizing the data, and abstracting the prediction function, I got a result more in line with what I expected.
            <br><br>
            The attatched image shows the initial data in green, with a line of best fit calculated by desmos also in green, while the predicted calculations are shown in red.
            <br><br>
            Interestingly enough, when I plot a line of best fit for the predictions, it turns out to be identical to the green line of best fit from desmos (I'll call that a win).
